# Fusion-ViewDeck
A drop down menu for Autodesk Fusion displaying Home, Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Front &amp; Back Views. These can then be bound to shortcut keys via AnyShortcut.

For instance, H goes to the Home View for me. F goes to the Front View, etc. 

For Windows, copy viewdeck.py and manifest.json into:

C:\Users\\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\viewdeck

or more simply:

%appdata%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\viewdeck

Then, in Fusion, go to Utilities | Add Ins | the little plus sign | script or add-in from device and find the folder from above.

You will then have the dropdown displayed in the screenshot. Each menu item in that dropdown can be bound to a hotkey via AnyShortcut:
